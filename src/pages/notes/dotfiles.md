Stow vs RCM
===========

GNU Stow <https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/>

 •  GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager, useful for automatically (and safely) linking your dotfiles folder into your home directory. - <https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/>

 •  rcm is a set of well-documented shell scripts that help manage your dotfiles. It is easily installable on macOS with the homebrew package manager, but works on all Unix operating systems. - <https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm>
